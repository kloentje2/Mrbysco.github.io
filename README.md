This website was created due to an assigment from my school, (portfolio website) 
As I got a suggestion on a vertical Navigation by @firedingo, 
I thought of the Menu bar of Windows. And as Windows XP was the best in that, 
I thought: "Let's theme the website around Windows XP and let it look like it" And thats how this page started.
